## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- How to use background images (I think).
- More Grid.

```css
background-image: url(images/bg-pattern-bottom-mobile.svg), url(images/bg-pattern-top-mobile.svg);
background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;
background-position: bottom right, top left;   
```

### Continued development

- Get better at planning projects and being patient!
- I'd like to use a CSS transition in my next project.

## Questions
- Should I have used a header for the title section?
- I converted almost all my px values to rem. Overkill or good job?
- When I change screen width, the background "moves" relative to the page content. Is this okay? Or should they stay in the same place relative to the content?
- To test my changes, I take screenshots of the page then reduce the opacity and lay them over top the design images to evaluate how they match up. (I do this in Illustrator.) Is there a better way to test changes?


### Useful resources
